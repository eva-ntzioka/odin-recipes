            <ol>
                <li>
                    Chop the pancetta. Trim the celery, carrots and onion, and mince into fine pieces. Heat a pan with a drizzle of oil, sauté the pancetta, add the vegetables and gently sweat until soft.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the meat and sauté for 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup wine and allow to completely evaporate. Add the tomato passata and stir for a few minutes. Add 1/2 cup milk and cover with the broth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook the meat sauce for 2-3 hours, adding more broth every now and then while adjusting the seasoning. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook the tagliatelle in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes or until al dente, drain and serve with generous amounts of sauce.
